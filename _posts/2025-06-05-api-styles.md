## Introduction

APIs are the backbone of modern software design and integration, enabling seamless communication between disparate systems. SOAP and REST have long dominated the enterprise for their structured and accessible approaches. Modern alternatives like GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, and Webhooks offer greater flexibility, enhanced performance, and real-time capabilities. Each architectural style brings unique strengths, allowing software architects and engineers to choose the best fit for specific use cases and operational demands.

These API styles sample endpoints can be tested by importing into Postman Collections. <https://github.com/rameshagowda/api-styles>

## 1. SOAP

SOAP is an XML-based protocol with a robust, standardized contract defined via WSDL, which ensures secure and reliable communication in enterprise environments. It is ideal for systems that require strict message formatting, built-in error handling, and formal transaction support.

ASMX (in the example) refers to the file extension used for legacy SOAP-based web services in Microsoft's ASP.NET framework. These ".asmx" files serve as endpoints that automatically handle SOAP messagingâ€”packaging, transmitting, and receiving XML messages according to the SOAP protocol.

### How to make SOAP request using Postman?

1. Use this SOAP endpoint to test - https://www.w3schools.com/xml/tempconvert.asmx
2. Select POST from the request method dropdown list.
3. In "Headers" tab,

- Add Content-Type to "application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8"
- SOAPAction to "#POST"

4. In the Body tab, select raw and choose XML from the dropdown list.This is how sample request and response looks like for a SOAP endpoint.

## 2. REST

REST uses standard HTTP methods to manipulate resources, typically exchanging data in JSON or XML. Its stateless, lightweight nature makes it highly scalable and easy to integrate with web and mobile applications.

- GET example
  URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
  Method: GET
  Returns: A list of sample posts in JSON format.

- POST example
  URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
  Method: POST
  Headers: Content-Type: application/json
  Body (raw JSON): {
  "title": "New Post Title",
  "body": "This is the content of the post.",
  "userId": 1
  }

- Can we mix these APIs in the same Product?

  Yes, of course, we can use all of them together to execute an API strategy. Each API styles are best suited for certain use cases. For example, REST APIs are user friednly and can be used to expose to external users. gRPC is best suited for internal client server use cases like in microservices. So we can provide REST endpoints to external users, but internal transactions, calculations, communications can be handled with gRPC

## API test automation strategy

- Unit Test
- Integration Test
  - Using Mocks
  - Using variables to exchange info between API calls
- Contract test and Schema validation
- End to end API test
  - Functional Test
  - Load and Performance Test
  - SQL Injection security check
  - Regression Testing
