## Introduction
oAuth2 and OpenIDConnect are two industry standard protocols for Authorization and Authentication. oAuth2 is protocol that controls and delegates authorization to access a protected resource, like your webapp or a api service.
OIDC is built on top of oAuth2. It is used to verify the identity of the user and provide additional information about the user and scope. OIDC enables single sign-on scenarios, where one login can be used across multiple applications. 

This blog outlines the steps and components involved in securing APIs with Azure APIM using oAuth2.

### Prerequisites
Azure API Management - to protect Azure FunctionApp. public access to Azure function endpoint is restricted. Can be called only from APIM.
Azure EntraID - To register APIM backend and client app (in this case Postman), define role and scope.
Azure FunctionApp - Simple Httptrigger with Get endpoint that returns a simple message.


## Architecture

    * Postman is a client app in this case. It requests a JWT access token from Azure Entra ID using app registration client id and client secret. This is OIDC.
    * Azure Entra returns JWT access token.
    * Postman makes a request to APIM endpoint with Bearer token in the Authorization header.
    * APIM validates the token with Azure Entra ID.
    * APIM returns success payload or 401 unauthorization error.

In your scenario, you are using OIDC to authenticate the user/application and obtain a JWT token. You are then using OAuth 2.0 to authorize the client to access the protected resource, which is the API via APIM.
