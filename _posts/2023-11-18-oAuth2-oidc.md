## Introduction
This blog outlines the steps and components involved in securing APIs with Azure APIM using oAuth2.

### Prerequisites
Azure API Management: to protect Azure FunctionApp. public access to Azure function endpoint is restricted. Can be called only from APIM.
Azure EntraID: To register APIM backend and client app (in this case Postman), define role and scope.
Azure FunctionApp: Simple Httptrigger with Get endpoint that returns a simple message.


## Architecture

    * Postman is a client app in this case. It requests a JWT access token from Azure Entra ID using app registration client id and client secret. This is OIDC.
    * Azure Entra returns JWT access token.
    * Postman makes a request to APIM endpoint with Bearer token in the Authorization header.
    * APIM validates the token with Azure Entra ID.
    * APIM returns success payload or 401 unauthorization error.

In your scenario, you are using OIDC to authenticate the user/application and obtain a JWT token. You are then using OAuth 2.0 to authorize the client to access the protected resource, which is the API via APIM.
