## Design guidelines for Azure API management landing zone
API Gateway is an additional / facade layer that provides unified security and governance capabilites to manage REST, SOAP, WebSockets and GraphQL based APIs. We can also bring Azure Integration services like App Logic and Function App under APIM.

The Azure API Management landing zone accelerator provides an architectural approach and reference implementation to prepare landing zone subscriptions for a scalable API Management infrastructure. The implementation adheres to the architecture and best practices of the Cloud Adoption Framework's Azure landing zones with a focus on the design principles of enterprise-scale.

Customers adopt API Management in various ways. The architectural approach can be used as design guidance for greenfield implementation and as an assessment for brownfield customers already using API Management. The reference implementation can be adapted to produce an architecture that fits your way and puts your organization on a path to sustainable scale.

The Azure API Management landing zone accelerator assumes that a platform foundation that takes care of the shared services (network, security, identity, and governance) required to effectively construct and operationalize an enterprise-scale landing zone has been successfully implemented.

## Conceptual reference architecture
API Management deployed in a virtual network in internal mode, fronted by an Application Gateway, with sample Azure Functions backends.
